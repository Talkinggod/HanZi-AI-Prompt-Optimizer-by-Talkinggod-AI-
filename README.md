Advanced Optimization Panel: A new UI section that allows you to:
Select a target LLM model (e.g., Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) to apply model-specific syntax optimizations.
Enable Anthropic-style XML tagging to structure prompts for better clarity and performance.
Choose a reasoning strategy like Tree-of-Thoughts or ReWOO to guide the model's problem-solving process.
Sophisticated Prompt Construction: The backend logic now chains your selections together, wrapping the original prompt in layers of targeted instructions (XML tags, reasoning modules, model-specific prefixes) before sending it to the Gemini API for optimization.
Performance Metrics: The app now provides deeper insights beyond just token counts. After each optimization, a new panel displays:
Latency: The time taken for the optimization request to complete.
Semantic Fidelity & Instruction Adherence: Mocked scores that simulate how well the optimized prompt retains the original's meaning and follows instructions, demonstrating a more holistic approach to quality analysis.
Seamless Integration: All new components are built to match the existing visual theme, ensuring a consistent and professional user experience.
